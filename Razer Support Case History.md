Called 1 (888) 697-2037 from Google of "razer phone support"

Jude said he talked to supervisor and explained my problem with 
getting OSVR HDK V1.3 running on Linux or Razer Forge TV.

I am trying to discover design criteria and specs but with
many files in the repostory being produced by proprietary 
windows based tools, I see a difficult time for Linux.
The [definition of Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)
has been diluted for Microsoft based projects.
It used to be you could duplicate the effort with FREE tools often on
Linux as it was the most typical FREE Open Source Operating System.

Now with Microsoft Open Source projects just giving source material
away for free constitutes fulfilling the contract as Open Source. The
materials can't be used with out buying expensive Windows based software
in the case of OSVR. Also, there is no funtional Linux demo or prototype
it seems to be expected the community will develop or fix the code even
though it hasn't been worked on by any Linux developers for a long time.

I am writing this note in hopes of reducing my anxiety for getting involved
in this development effort without programming knowledge.

It seems amazing that I was involved in making things work with Linux from
1995 and yet there is very little in the OSVR HDK V1.3 to begin with that works
at this time a year after it was [announced](http://sensics.com/industry-leaders-announce-open-platform-for-virtual-reality-gaming/)
and [demonstated](http://vrguy.blogspot.com/2015/01/open-source-virtual-reality-week-after.html)
at CES 2015.
