#Developer - Razer Forge TV

### Much of this is extracted from <http://developer.razerzone.com/forge-tv/developer-setup/>

The Forge connects to your PC through the USB 2.0 A-to-A cable. 

Modify the adb usb configure file to add the new vendor id 0x1532.

###I choose to use ADB over WiFi as desribed in <http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html#wireless>

I have ADB Studio installed on the larger I7 Mini

and the NFS mounter <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo>
or xRdp and Remmina installed from Software Center or syaptic for remote desktop from MacBook Air.
Both systems are running Ubuntu Studio 15.10 presently.
They also use ReFind to dual boot to OS X if necessary.
